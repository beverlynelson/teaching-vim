High School Resources
=======================

### [Open Vim](http://www.openvim.com/)

* Sandbox option is really nice and much less intimidating for the kids
* Tutorial walks slowly enough through, perfect for high schoolers

### [Vim Trainer](http://vimtrainer.sourceforge.net/)

### [Shortcut Foo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/tutorial/vim)
Tool for practicing key combinations and building muscle memory.  Note: also has command line and sublime resources. 

### [Script from gmccreight to master vim](https://gist.github.com/beverlynelson/8753918)

The advanced high school group would enjoy this the most.
